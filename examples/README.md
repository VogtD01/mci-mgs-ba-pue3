# Things to remeber for all examples

## All examples contain the boot.py, main.py, occasionaly the lib folder and the pymakr.conf file. If you want to run the examples follow the steps below:
- Download and extract or clone the repository
- Add the respective example folder to your workspace in VSCode
- Add the folder .vscode and the .oylintrc file to your workspace so you see a project structure similar to the one below:
```
mpy_projects/
|-- micropython-stubs
|-- myExample/
    |--.vscode
    |-- .pylintrc
    |-- boot_ofmyexample.py
    |-- main_ofmyexample.py
    |-- pymakr_ofmyexample.conf
```
